# Micropython-Client-Server-using-PyQt5-and-Neopixel-Strip
This is from Paul McWhorter's Micropython series, Video 111 using PyQt5. I wrote the Code so as to use a Neopixel strip with 6 Colors. The Colors get turned On/Off from the Qt Window on the Client side. The Server side can be added to the Pi Pico W as main.py OR you can just make 2 Thonny windows. This Code is Released as is, Have Fun!
